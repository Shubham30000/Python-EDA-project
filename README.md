# Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project showcasing my ability to analyze and interpret complex datasets using Python. The project emphasizes solving real-world data challenges, implementing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and generating insights to guide data-driven decision-making.

# Key Highlights of the Project
Problem-Specific Notebooks:
The project is divided into modular Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on specific problem statements. Each notebook demonstrates a clear workflow, starting with data loading and preprocessing to the final analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I implemented EDA techniques to extract meaningful insights from the datasets. This includes:

Statistical summaries (mean, median, mode, etc.).
Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. Applied techniques such as:

Imputing missing values.
Normalizing and standardizing numerical data.
Encoding categorical variables for better model compatibility.
Python Implementation:
Used Python extensively for data handling and analysis, leveraging libraries such as:

# Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
# NumPy: For numerical operations.
# Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
# Scikit-learn: For any applied machine learning or statistical methods.
Key Challenges Addressed:

Extracted insights and summarized large datasets effectively.
Created reusable and well-documented code for consistent results.
Tackled multiple data-related challenges by writing optimized Python scripts.
Insights and Results:
Concluded each notebook with actionable insights drawn from the analysis. The results provide a deeper understanding of the dataset's dynamics and offer potential business or research implications.

Repository Structure
Problem Notebooks: Each problem is addressed in its corresponding notebook (prblm1.ipynb, prblm2.ipynb, etc.).
